# NLU Assignment 1
There are three python files:
"NLU1.py" is the file which contains the processing code for brown corpus. 
"NLU1_gutenberg.py" is the file that contains the processing code for gutenberg corpus
"brownPLUSgutenberg.py" is the file that contains the processing code for combined corpus and testing of perplexity is done once for D1 test and once for D2 test.
Sentences of 10 words are generated in ach of the models and perplexity is calculated on the test data (with print command).
"NLU1_model.py" is the same code as "NLU1.py" with the exception that it does not print the perplexity of my models and hence is used only for generating sentences.
